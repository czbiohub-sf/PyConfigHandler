# To add other VIDs, PIDs, or IDs, separate values with a comma (no space!).
# Set SEARCH_PID_VID to `no` to blindly poll all available serial ports. If
# enabled, all filters will be applied unless commented out.

# Vendor and Product IDs allow a device on a serial port to be identified
# without sending nonstandard data over the line and are virually universal.
# Target ID is a software defined ID that is reported when queried.
